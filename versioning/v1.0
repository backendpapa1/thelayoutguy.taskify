# V1.0

Signup Flow
- User enter email and password and name
- Logic confirm email does not exist in a basic settings of a provider
- Email is validated
- Password is validated and hashed
- User account is created and a queue processor is called to handle account setup.



## Focus
1. Confirm Bullmq is well setup
2. Confirm entity id is well setup
3. work on the signup endpoint. split logic across auth and user service.
4. Implement queue to setup account. and ensure when it fails its retried -> Add to redis log that will be accessed via api and sse to monitor failure statistics on redis..we will setup a seperate queue that receives redis processing status and store them up




Bullmq
- events can be listened to
- we can pause or resume queue from the dashboard
- we can sandbox processes to ensure that when it crashes it does not affect main worker, run blocking codes without afecting quueue, use multicore better and reduces connection to redis
